# What is this?
Playground to test different testing frameworks. The goal is for comparison of learnings. So its a fair test I have created a simple service which has another service injected, a public method, and a private method.

# Install
Install is just simple, just run:
> composer install

# Running Tests

### PHP Unit
To run the phpunit suite, use the following command:
> bin/phpunit --verbose tests


### PHP Sopec
To run the php spec suite, use the following command:
> bin/phpspec run
